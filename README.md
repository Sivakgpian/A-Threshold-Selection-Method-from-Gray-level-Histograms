This project introduces A Threshold Selection Method from Gray-level Histograms
To determine an optimal threshold value to separate objects of interest from the background. 
Iteratively calculates the threshold value at each gray level of the image.
we use first order moments and weights to make it simple and to decrease computaional time.
